# Wordle-Solver
You the game - Wordle? Well this program tries to solve it. The key word is tries.

This is Frank - my college roommate Frank. He studies Classics and History - and - he is very good at Wordle. Very good. As a classics major, he writes a lot of papers, and so he has a sharp mind for vocab. 

I am an engineer, and as the stereotype goes... we can't spell to save our life. The engineering school at UofT is literally Skule (school), so I mean it makes some sense.

But, I can do something Frank cannot - solve integrals! - No of course not, he can also do that.

I can knd
