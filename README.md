# Wordle-Solver
You know the game: Wordle? Well this program tries to solve it (the key word is tries) - solve it better than humans.


(Insert Picture of Frank)
This is Frank - my college roommate Frank. He studies Classics and History - and - he is very good at Wordle. Very good. As a classics major, he writes a lot of papers, and so he has a sharp mind for vocab. This guy literally has a 200 day streak on Wordle, until of course I took over his phone. That's how good he is.

I am an engineer, and as the stereotype goes... we can't spell to save our lives. The engineering school at UofT is literally spelled Skule (you figure), so I mean it makes some sense.


But, I can do something Frank cannot - drink 20 pints of beer! - No of course not, I can't do that, but he can't either. Ha.

I can (mediocrely) code. And Steve once said that the computer is like a bicycle for the mind, and as engineers, we build things that enhance our abilities to do whatever the heck we want. I believe that.

This is a journey - a journey to optimize and make the best Wordle solver I can build - in JS (because I need practice lol).

# V1: The concept that might work - but code that definitely breaks
